# Project Dalek by BryTack

A small Arduino turntable experiment I built while learning the basics. This is a fun, personal project for tinkering and practice, not a polished or production-ready build.

## What this is
- A simple turntable test sketch for Arduino.
- Built to explore motors, timing, and basic control logic.

## What this is not
- A finished product.
- A reference design or best-practice example.

## Notes
Expect rough edges and lots of learning along the way. Feedback and suggestions are welcome!
